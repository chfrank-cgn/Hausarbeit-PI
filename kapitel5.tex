The Digital Live Studium addresses the needs of students who cannot attend lectures in person, for personal reasons or because of location. Especially for people tied up in care work, the ability to participate in a live lecture without leaving home is a big plus and greatly enhances the DLS's value proposition.

Other players in the secondary education market have also embraced the idea, further validating the innovation and its usefulness.

We can conclude that DLS is a highly successful innovation by FOM, and that it will help the university stay competitive in the tight education market.

A further enhancement could be allowing the lecturers to work from home or their personal office.

Happy teaching!
